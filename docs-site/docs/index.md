# Geoapify Geocoder Autocomplete

The **Geoapify Geocoder Autocomplete** is a **JavaScript / TypeScript** library that brings advanced **address and place autocomplete** functionality to web applications and HTML pages. It helps users quickly find and select accurate locations while improving form usability and map interaction.

Powered by Geoapify’s APIs, the library combines the strengths of:

* [**Address Autocomplete API**](https://www.geoapify.com/address-autocomplete/) — for real-time, high-quality address and place suggestions as the user types.
* [**Places API**](https://www.geoapify.com/places-api/) — for category-based search and exploring points of interest such as restaurants, cafes, and landmarks.

By integrating both APIs, the library supports intelligent **address search**, **autofill**, and **category-based place discovery** within a single, easy-to-use component. It can be embedded in any modern web app, works without UI frameworks, and is fully compatible with mapping libraries like **Leaflet**, **MapLibre GL**, or **OpenLayers**.

## Features

1. **Easy to Integrate**
   Quickly add smart address or place autocomplete to any web page or application. The component can be embedded inside any HTML container (e.g., a `DIV` element) and works seamlessly with your existing UI and map setup.

2. **Fine-Tuning and Control**
   Adjust search behavior with **filters** and **bias parameters** — limit results by country, bounding box, circle, or proximity. This flexibility helps return the most relevant and context-aware suggestions for your users.

3. **Address Collection and Verification**
   Use the library to build structured address input forms, collect verified addresses, and automatically fill in city, postal code, and country fields. Perfect for checkout pages, registration forms, and delivery address validation.

4. **Optional Place Details Integration**
   Enhance selected results with detailed information and geometries by connecting to the [Geoapify Place Details API](https://www.geoapify.com/place-details-api/). Retrieve building outlines, city boundaries, and additional metadata for improved map visualization.

5. **Optional Category Search**
   Extend the autocomplete to support category-based search using the [Geoapify Places API](https://www.geoapify.com/places-api/). Let users explore nearby points of interest such as restaurants, hotels, or gas stations directly from the dropdown.

6. **Customizable Look and Feel**
   Style the autocomplete to match your application’s design. Choose from built-in light and dark themes or override styles using your own CSS classes for complete visual consistency.

7. **Zero Dependencies**
   Built with no external dependencies, the library is lightweight, fast, and framework-agnostic. It integrates easily with any modern frontend or map library such as Leaflet, MapLibre GL, or OpenLayers.
